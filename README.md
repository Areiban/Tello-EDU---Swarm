# Tello-EDU---Swarm
First version to swarming Tello EDU drones

For the optimal test and practice with this project it is recommended to try in a room 3 meters long x 3 meters wide and 2 meters high.

Note: 
* The code that is posted here has been continuously tested, and is believed to be an error-free version.
* It is important that you previously configure the IP addresses that will be assigned to the drones, associating them with the MAC address of each of them. For this purpose use AP Mode script and set in the function set_ap('Tello_Nest', 'tellotello')
Tello_Nest = The Tello Network that you have previous assigned
tellotello = Your password... For example: "1234"
